# OOP school library

>  In this project I need a tool to help me record what books are in the universitie's library and who borrows them. The app that I will create will allow me to:

     Add new students or teachers.
     Add new books.
     Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Terminal
- IRB
- Robocop (linters)
